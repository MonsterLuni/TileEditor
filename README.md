# TileEditor
The purpose of this project is to make it easier to make maps that are tile-based.
The program takes in images as tiles, you can import these files at the beginning of the Application.
After that it maps each Image as an Integer and creates a .txt file in which all of the placed Tiles
are being marked down.

This .txt file then can be read by another software.
