# TileEditor
The purpose of this project is to make it easier to make maps that are tile-based.
The program takes in images as tiles, you can import these files at the beginning of the Application.
After that it maps each Image as an Integer and creates a .txt file in which all of the placed Tiles
are being marked down.
